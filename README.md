A tool for playing full-screen, juicy special effects.  Currently a work-in-progress.

## Install

There are two common methods for installing this package.

### Through [Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html)

Unity's own Package Manager supports [importing packages through a URL to a Git repo](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html):

1. First, on this repository page, click the "Clone or download" button, and copy over this repository's HTTPS URL.  
2. Then click on the + button on the upper-left-hand corner of the Package Manager, select "Add package from git URL..." on the context menu, then paste this repo's URL!

While easy and straightforward, this method has a few major downside: it does not support dependency resolution and package upgrading when a new version is released.  To add support for that, the following method is recommended:

### Through [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/)

Installing via [OpenUPM's command line tool](https://openupm.com/) is recommended because it supports dependency resolution, upgrading, and downgrading this package.  If you haven't already [installed OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/docs/getting-started.html#installing-openupm-cli), you can do so through Node.js's `npm` (obviously have Node.js installed in your system first):
```
npm install -g openupm-cli
```
Then, to install this package, just run the following command at the root of your Unity project:
```
openupm add com.omiyagames.gamefeel
```
